TOSA FlatBuffers python serialization library
=============================================

Files in this directory are automatically generated by running:

``` bash
../build/thirdparty/flatbuffers/flatc --python ../serialization/tosa.fbs
```

From the ``verif/`` directory.  Flatc is compiled along with the *TOSA
Reference Model*.

*Because they are automatically generated, please do not edit the
python files in this directory by hand.*
