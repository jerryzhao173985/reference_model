# ðŸŽ‰ TOSA Reference Model Deep Dive - Complete Success!

## What We Achieved

We successfully created working examples that demonstrate the TOSA reference model's graph execution mechanism from high-level scheduling down to individual tensor operations.

### 1. **Simple Tensor Demo** (`simple_tensor_demo`)
- Standalone implementation showing core concepts
- Clear step-by-step execution with ready-list scheduling
- No external dependencies - compiles with just C++17

### 2. **Full TOSA Example** (`test_graph_example`)  
- Uses actual TOSA reference model infrastructure
- Demonstrates real SubgraphTraverser, GraphNode, and Tensor classes
- Shows how the reference model optimizes execution

## Key Learnings from the Deep Dive

### Graph Execution Flow

```
1. TosaSerializationHandler (holds the graph structure)
   â†“
2. SubgraphTraverser (schedules execution)
   â†“
3. GraphNode (individual operations)
   â†“
4. Tensor (data storage and validity tracking)
```

### How SubgraphTraverser Works

1. **Initialization** (`initializeGraph()`)
   - Creates GraphNode objects for each operation
   - Builds initial ready list with nodes that have no dependencies

2. **Linking** (`linkTensorsAndNodes()`)
   - Connects tensors to their producer/consumer nodes
   - Establishes the dataflow graph

3. **Validation** (`validateGraph()`)
   - Checks tensor shapes and types
   - Ensures graph is well-formed

4. **Execution** (`evaluateAll()`)
   - Uses ready-list scheduling:
     ```cpp
     while (!readyList.empty()) {
         node = readyList.pop()
         node->eval()  // Execute the operation
         // Mark output tensors as valid
         // Add newly-ready consumers to ready list
     }
     ```

### Tensor Validity Tracking

The key to dataflow execution is tensor validity:
- Each tensor has an `isValid` flag
- Nodes can only execute when ALL inputs are valid
- After execution, output tensors become valid
- This triggers downstream nodes to become ready

### Operator Implementation

Each operator (like ABS, ADD) inherits from `GraphNode` and implements:
- `checkTensorAttributes()` - Validate input/output compatibility
- `eval()` - Perform the actual computation
- Template-based for different data types (FP32, INT8, etc.)

## Running the Examples

```bash
# Simple demo - shows step-by-step execution
./simple_tensor_demo

# Full TOSA example - uses real infrastructure  
./test_graph_example
```

Both demonstrate: `input1 -> ABS -> temp -> ADD(temp, input2) -> output`

## Build System Insights

The build script intelligently:
1. Detects if TOSA reference model is built
2. Finds dependencies in `build/_deps/` (Eigen, FlatBuffers, etc.)
3. Links appropriate libraries
4. Falls back to simple demo if full build isn't available

## Files Created

1. **test_graph_example.cpp** - Full TOSA integration
2. **simple_tensor_demo.cpp** - Standalone demo  
3. **build_test_graph.sh** - Smart build script
4. **graph_execution_pseudocode.cpp** - Conceptual overview
5. **custom_ir_integration.md** - Guide for building custom IR on top
6. **README_graph_example.md** - Detailed documentation

## Next Steps

With this understanding, you can now:
1. Add new operators by extending GraphNode
2. Build custom graph representations that compile to TOSA
3. Integrate with your own tensor libraries
4. Create optimization passes at the graph level
5. Build debugging/profiling tools

The reference model provides a solid foundation for experimenting with tensor computation graphs while maintaining TOSA compliance.
